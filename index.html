Inspired by the classic Minesweeper, Mines will simply reveal the gems and avoid the bombs to increase your payout multiplier.</p><p><strong>Mines</strong> is a grid-based gambling game of chance <a href=\"https://stake.com/casino/group/stake-originals\">developed by Stake</a> where players navigate the grid to reveal gems while avoiding bombs! This Mines betting game is played on a 5x5 grid in which players can flip the tiles over to show either a gem or bomb.</p><p>Revealing gems increases payout multipliers and allows players to continue playing - choosing to pick additional tiles, a random tile or cash out. Revealing a bomb ends the round with the wager lost.</p><p>With the freedom to adjust the number of mines, autobet and cash out at any point of the game, the gambling experience offered by Mines is second to none at any <a href=\"https://stake.com/casino/home\">online casino</a>!</p><h2>Mines Gameplay</h2><p>Players set their bet amount to play with during a round of Mines as well as the number of mines that exists in the field of play, ranging between 1-24.

More mines in play lead to more opportunities for a round to end, but also leads to exciting gameplay and higher payouts.</p><p>The choice of setting the mines amount reflects the player&#x27;s appetite for risk and the level of risk they are willing to burden in pursuit of profit and big payouts.</p><p>Once the bet amount and number of mines have been set, players can click any number of tiles during the betting round to reveal their contents. Hitting a mine will end the round. However, if a player continues to collect gems they can continue to play.</p><h3>Cashout or Keep Mining</h3><p>During the phase where players have collected gems and have not tripped any mines yet, the betting interface is modified and they are informed of the <strong>Profit on Next Tile</strong> and <strong>Total Profit </strong>in the current betting round<strong>.</strong></p><p>This helps players evaluate risk and best decide what is the best course of action - cash out winnings or keep going!</p><h2>Bet Fiat &amp; Crypto on Mines</h2><p>Players can bet <a href=\"https://stake.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> on Mines or use their <a href=\"https://stake.com/blog/what-crypto-does-stake-offer\">choice of other available cryptocurrencies</a> for placing wagers on the Stake casino. </p><p>You can also play at Stake.com with the following local currencies – ARS, CLP, BRL, JPY, INR, and PEN.
